    Tap “Server Settings”
    Tap “Roles”
    Scroll down to the General Permissions setting and toggle “Administrator” on
    Click “Save Changes”
    
Step 2 - add bot to derver. Requires Administrator Access (see step 1)
  go to: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=802188578708520980&permissions=74752&scope=bot
  Use the add to server dropbox to select the server you’d like to add the Bot to.
