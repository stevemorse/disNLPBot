To add to a Discord guild/server:
(some content from:https://www.alphr.com/add-bots-discord-server/)

Step 1 – Turn On Administrator Access on the server you wish to add the bot to

Step 2 - add TACbot to server. Requires Administrator Access (see step 1)
In your browser "go to" (type in the following HTTP command in the navigation go to bar): 
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=802188578708520980&scope=bot&permissions=0

You may still have to authorize the bot even though the command uses Oauth2 to do that very thing.
You may have to fill in an “I’m not a robot” captcha.
